# 🏡 California Housing Price Estimator

A Machine Learning web application that predicts housing prices in California based on census data. This project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor and provides an interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of the California Housing dataset. It includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations and distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Log transformations to handle skewed data, one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Using a Random Forest Regressor for accurate price estimation.
- **Deployment:** A user-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (Web Interface)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Joblib** (Model Serialization)

## 📂 Repository Structure

California-Housing-Prediction/ │ ├── house_price_prdiction_model.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook for EDA, preprocessing, and training ├── house_pred_app.py # Streamlit application script ├── housing.csv # Dataset (Ensure this is present) ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies ├── forest_model.pkl # Trained model (generated by the notebook) └── model_columns.pkl # Column names (generated by the notebook)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone [https://github.com/Furqan-Majeed/California-Housing-Prediction.git]
cd California-Housing-Prediction

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is missing, install manually: pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib matplotlib seaborn)

### 3. Generate Model Files
Before running the app, you need the trained model files. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open house_price_prdiction_model.ipynb.

Run all cells to train the model.

This will generate forest_model.pkl and model_columns.pkl in your directory.

### 4. Run the Application
Start the Streamlit app with the following command:

Bash

streamlit run house_pred_app.py
🧠 Model Logic
The application expects specific inputs processed in the same way as the training data:

Log Transformations: Applied to total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, and households to normalize skewed distributions.

Feature Engineering: Ratios like bedroom_ratio (bedrooms/rooms) and household_rooms (rooms/households) are calculated dynamically.

Encoding: The ocean_proximity feature is one-hot encoded to match the training set structure.
